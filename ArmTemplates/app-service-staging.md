appServiceAppSettings: (optional) array of object

Array of app settings to be created.
Will not create any app settings if not supplied.

        "name": "",
        "value": ""
    }

    }
]
```

customHostName: (optional) string

Custom fully qualified domain name for the app service URL.
If not provided then the app service will have the URL https://appServiceName.azurewebsites.net/.

In order to specify a custom domain, a CNAME DNS record must be created referencing appServiceName.azurewebsites.net

certificateThumbprint: (optional) string

Thumbprint of the certificate used.
Only required if the customHostName is supplied above.

This can be passed into the template via the following reference function if an Azure certificate resource has been created:
> [reference(resourceId(parameters('certificateResourceGroup'), 'Microsoft.Web/certificates', parameters('certificateName')), '2016-03-01').Thumbprint]

clientAffinity: (optional) boolean

Enable ARR Affinity cookie (also known as sticky sessions).
Often required for stateful web applications.
Defaults to not enabled (stateless).

If ARR Affinity is enabled the server will place a cookie on responses that causes a user to always hit the same instance within their session.
This has a load balancing penalty (existing clients cannot be balanced away from an instance running hot) so is disabled by default.
